Staying physically active is one of the best ways to keep your mind and body healthy. In many areas, people can visit parks, trails, and open spaces as a way to relieve stress, get some fresh air and vitamin D, stay active, and safely connect with others. While these facilities and areas can offer health benefits, it is important that you follow the linked steps to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.
